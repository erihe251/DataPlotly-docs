[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/dataplotly-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://dataplotly-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The DataPlotly plugin allows creation of ![D3](https://d3js.org/)-like
interactive plots directly within QGIS, thanks to the ![Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)
library and its Python API.

The official plugin repository is [here](https://github.com/ghtmtt/DataPlotly).
